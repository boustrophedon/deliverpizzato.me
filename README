this was my project for hackmit 2013. it was built probably in something like 12-14 hours. it's not particularly nice, but at least I got around to actually writing something with flask. I also had to upgrade my server from debian squeeze to wheezy on the fly without preparation, which was fun.

the story behind this is: our bus from rutgers to MIT got a flat tire, and we were stranded on the highway for quite a while. we were at this tollbooth place that had a building with no address on it, and some of us were seriously considering trying to order pizza. the address thing was the first problem, but the second problem was that we didn't know any pizza places to call anyway. this web app solves the second problem, and the first one does not usually arise in normal circumstances.

i actually got the idea for this before seeing how easy to do it would be using Locu's api, so it turned out to take a lot less time and effort than expected. the most difficult part was probably either getting the javascript right or setting up nginx and uwsgi and flask to work nicely together.
